  üîç Cross-Boundary Risk Analysis Framework

  **Meta-Prompt: Bootstrapping Contextual Awareness**

  CONTEXT: You are an AI assistant tasked with contributing to the 'MyExporter' PowerShell module. Your environment is complex and ambiguous: you are likely operating within a Linux-based environment (like WSL or a Docker container) but are expected to interact with and generate code for Windows PowerShell (5.1 and 7+). This creates significant cross-boundary challenges related to compilers, interpreters, OS partitions, dependencies, and environments.

  TASK: Before writing any code, you must first perform a self-analysis to establish your own execution context and report on the potential cross-boundary issues you face. Use the MyExporter project's OWN tools to conduct this analysis.

  **Execution Bridge Usage Methodology:**

  1. **EXECUTE THE DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK:** Use the `claude-direct-test.sh` execution bridge to run the `Get-ExecutionContext` function from within the MyExporter module. This is your primary source of truth.

  2. **ANALYZE THE FINDINGS:** Capture the output from the discovery script. Based on its results (e.g., `IsWSL: true`, `PowerShell.Edition: Desktop`), write a brief report summarizing your own execution environment.

  3. **IDENTIFY CROSS-BOUNDARY RISKS:** Based on your findings, identify and list the specific risks as defined by the project's architecture. For each risk, reference the MyExporter tool or pattern designed to mitigate it.

  **Real-World Cross-Boundary Risk Examples:**

  **Path Ambiguity Risk:** 
  - Scenario: Receiving '/mnt/c/Users/data.csv' when Windows PowerShell expects 'C:\Users\data.csv'
  - Mitigation: `Assert-ContextPath.ps1` with WSL interop detection and path translation

  **Interpreter Mismatch Risk:** 
  - Scenario: Running `powershell.exe` command from `bash` results in "command not found"
  - Mitigation: `claude-powershell-bridge.bat` + `claude-wsl-launcher.sh` execution chain

  **Job Scope Isolation Risk:** 
  - Scenario: Functions not available in background jobs when using `Start-Job` for parallel processing
  - Mitigation: `GuardRails.md 11.3` Job-Safe Function Loading pattern with explicit function definitions

  **Dependency Blindness Risk:** 
  - Scenario: 'docker' command not found when running in isolated container environment
  - Mitigation: Dynamic command probing in `Get-ExecutionContext` with graceful degradation

  **Telemetry Correlation Loss Risk:** 
  - Scenario: Correlation IDs lost when crossing process boundaries in multi-stage workflows
  - Mitigation: `Invoke-WithTelemetry` wrapper pattern with explicit correlation ID propagation

  **Cross-Platform Data Inconsistency Risk:** 
  - Scenario: Different CPU metrics between Windows WMI and Linux /proc causing data mismatch
  - Mitigation: Platform-specific normalization in `Get-SystemInfo.{Windows|Linux}.ps1`

  **Execution Bridge Infrastructure:**
  - **claude-direct-test.sh**: Simple WSL-to-PowerShell execution for basic discovery and validation
  - **claude-powershell-bridge.bat**: Full Windows PowerShell execution with comprehensive testing scenarios
  - **claude-wsl-launcher.sh**: Advanced cross-platform workflow with output file analysis and verification
  - **Execution Chain Pattern**: WSL bash ‚Üí cmd.exe ‚Üí powershell.exe for maximum compatibility across environments
